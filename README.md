# MeroDocs

**MeroDocs** is a privacy-first e-signature platform built on **Calimero**.  
It empowers users on independent nodes to securely collaborate, sign PDF contracts peer-to-peer,  
and publicly attest document integrity via the **Internet Computer (ICP)** — all without centralized servers or intermediaries.

## Project Overview & Current Status

### Default Context (User’s Private Workspace)

- Each user creates a **private default context** on their node.
- This context stores:
  - The user’s **signature library**
  - A list of **agreements** (shared contexts) the user belongs to

### Creating or Joining Agreements

- **Create Agreement**: A user creates a new shared context and becomes the Admin.
- **Invite Collaborators**: The Admin generates an **invite payload** using other participants’ Calimero identity and assigns permissions (view/sign).
- **Join Agreement**: A user on a different node enters the invite payload and names the agreement on their node.

### Shared Context Workflow

- Multiple users across nodes join a **shared context**.
- Within the shared agreement:
  - Users **upload PDFs**
  - Members can **view or sign**, according to their permissions
  - Access remains restricted to invited participants—**no third parties have access**

### Signature Library

Each user can maintain a **personal signature library** within their private default context. This feature allows users to:

- **Create and Store Signatures**: Users can draw their digital signatures securely within their private workspace
- **Reuse Signatures**: Once created, signatures can be applied to multiple documents without recreating them
- **Privacy-First Storage**: All signatures remain stored locally on the user's node—never exposed to external parties
- **Quick Access**: Stored signatures are readily available when signing documents, streamlining the signing process

The signature library ensures both convenience and security, allowing users to maintain consistent digital signatures while preserving complete privacy and control over their signing credentials.

### PDF Upload & Signing with ICP Integration

- When a PDF is uploaded to the context:
  - Its **original SHA‑256 hash** is recorded on the **ICP canister**
- After signing:
  - The **signed PDF** is saved back into the context
  - The **final document hash** is recorded on ICP
- A **"Verify on ICP"** button enables:
  - Recomputing the local PDF hash
  - Comparing it with the on-chain value
  - Confirms whether the document matches the recorded state or has been tampered with

### AI Legal Chatbot (Powered by ICP_LLM)

User can now use **AI-powered legal chatbot** integrated with **ICP_LLM**, leveraging **Llama 3.1 8B parameter model** for document analysis. This feature maintains user privacy by storing all data locally on calimero code and processing all prompts using ICP_LLM .

- **Document Upload & Embedding Generation**: When a user uploads a document (e.g., PDF), the system generates embeddings and store them on the Calimero node. These embeddings capture the semantic content of the document and are securely stored within the user's private context—never leaving the node or being exposed to external parties.
- **Chatbot Interaction**: Users can query the chatbot about uploaded documents. When a prompt is submitted:

  - The system retrieves the **top relevant embeddings** from the stored document data on the node.
  - These embeddings, along with the user's prompt and a few previous conversation messages, are sent as context to **ICP_LLM** running on the Internet Computer.
  - ICP_LLM processes the query using **Llama 3.1 8B model**, generating legal insights, summaries, or answers based on the document content.
  - Responses are returned to the user, with all processing ensuring that raw document content remains private and encrypted within Calimero.

- **Privacy-First Design**: Only anonymized embeddings and prompts are transmitted to ICP_LLM; the original document text is never shared. This allows for powerful AI assistance while upholding end-to-end privacy and compliance with data protection standards.

The AI legal chatbot enhances document collaboration by providing instant, AI-driven legal analysis, question-answering, and summarization, all while keeping user data secure and decentralized.

### Audit Trail

Three user actions are now audited on ICP, ensuring complete transparency and public accountability:

- **Document Upload**  
  When a user uploads a PDF, an upload event is recorded on the ICP canister.

- **User Consent**  
  Before signing, the user must provide explicit consent. This action is logged on ICP to form a tamper-proof record of intent.

- **Signing Event**  
  Once a user signs the document, that signing event (with timestamp and identity) is also logged on ICP.

Together, these logs create a reliable audit trail spanning from upload to signature—empowering both users and auditors with verifiable, immutable proof of every step in the process.

## Technical Implementation Details

**Calimero-Based Contexts**

- User-specific default context stores local signatures and membership.
- Shared contexts are created or joined via invite payloads.
- All interactions (invite, upload, sign) use Calimero RPC and encryption.

**ICP Integration**

- SHA‑256 hashes recorded for both original and signed PDFs.
- Public verification without exposing sensitive content.

**AI Legal Chatbot Implementation**

- **Embedding Generation**: Upon document upload, embeddings are generated stored on the Calimero node. These embeddings are stored encrypted within the user's private context.
- **Query Processing**: User prompts trigger retrieval of top-k relevant embeddings from the node. These are combined with the prompt and recent conversation history, then sent to ICP_LLM on the Internet Computer.
- **ICP_LLM Integration**: Utilizes **Llama 3.1 8B parameter model** hosted on ICP for inference. The system ensures only contextual embeddings and prompts are transmitted, maintaining full document privacy.
- **Response Handling**: AI-generated responses are delivered back to the user, with all processing decentralized and secure.

---

## Security & Privacy Assurance

- All documents remain encrypted within Calimero contexts.
- Only hashes are stored on-chain—no files ever leave user nodes.
- Access to documents is strictly permissioned, ensuring privacy and control.
- For the AI legal chatbot, embeddings and document content are never transmitted externally; only anonymized data reaches ICP_LLM, preserving user privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.
